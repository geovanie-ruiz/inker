# inker
Discord bot for Disney/Ravenburger's Lorcana TCG

# Usage
inker has two modes of use: in-line and slash commands.

## In-line
You can summon a card by using the "[[term]]" notation, where "term" is the character or descriptor of a card.

For example, [[Mickey Mouse]] will summon a Mickey Mouse card, whereas [[Brave Little Tailor]] will summon specifically
the Brave Little Tailor Mickey Mouse card.

## Slash command
You can also use /card term notation. This notation provides auto-complete and more control over the resultant card.

For example, /card Mickey Mouse will give you Brave Little Tailor and Sorcerer Mickey to choose from. Whereas typing in
"brave little tailor" or "sorcerer mickey" will summon the respective, specific card.
